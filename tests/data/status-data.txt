Mark Ruffalo:Wally Lamb : REGARDING THE DEMISE OF THE NEA : In my book travels , I often hear from readers that I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE is their favorite novel of mine . Please know that this book would not exist without the support of the National Endowment of the Arts . Midway through creating that story , I was about to give up writing . Life had become too complicated . I was balancing a full time teaching job with the needs of two elderly and infirm parents and the challenges of having adopted a special-needs child suffering from PTSD , attachment disorder , and other afflictions . A surprise call from the NEA 's Gigi Bradford , telling me I had been awarded a grant from the Endowment , allowed me to take a 6-month leave of absence from teaching and continue working on my story -- a novel that was subsequently translated into 16 different languages and chosen as the 17th selection for for Oprah 's Book Club . Add the demise of the NEA to the list of shameful moves made by the nightmarish administration that 's now in charge of our country . I mourn for all the novelist , poets , playwrights , painters , dancers , composers , and other creators of art who may now lack the encouragement of this arts-supportive organization . Thank you , NEA , and RIP if this proposed budget is passed . Art colors and illuminates life , Mr Trump . Stop draining the color out of what America means . Thank you , Wally Lamb .

# social-network-interest-engine

A user profile extractor primarily based on social web data which makes use of contextual data such as, location and time based data of users to improve the quality of output.

The extractor has modeled itself based on common social media network features such as, timelines, bookmarks, followings, communities and trends to allow multiple social network feed implementations to be integrated into the system. This social web feed data are used for user profiling along with aforementioned contextual data.

User profiles are represented in the form of interest tags which are semantically aware of themselves. Plus, a new ontology based user clustering mechanism has been introduced within this extractor which makes use of users' social web community based data.
